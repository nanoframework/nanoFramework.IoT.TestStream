# Maintainer documentation for TestStream.Runner and pipeline setup

This documentation is intended for maintainer to manage releases, setup pipelines and create PAT token for the users.

## Creating a new release

On PR on TestStream.Runner, only a build is done. This does allow flexibility to only create a release when the changes are not on documentation, on the nanoFramework PoC application or to have multiple PR merged before.

To create a release, go to [Actions](https://github.com/nanoframework/nanoFramework.IoT.TestStream/actions/workflows/build-and-publish.yml) and run the `Build, Version, and Publish TestStream.Runner` action. This will build the application a a single file, package the needed configuration files and setup scripts, create a changelog and set a version.

## Creating a PAT token for contributors

To avoid having to add every contributor who are willing to give some of their compute power to run hardware tests, an automatic mechanism with an Azure function will be built. In the mean time, PAT token can be created manually for a period that will be agreed with the contributor.

Manual steps:

* Go to <https://dev.azure.com/nanoframework/> then connect with the account you want to create the PAT token
* Click on the `user settings` to right

![use settings](./docs/pat-menu.png)

* Select `Personal access tokens`
* Click the top right button `New token`
* Click on the bottom `Show all scopes`
* Select `Read & manage` in `Agent Pools`

![pat selection](./docs/pat-selection.png)

* Give then name of the contributor to the token
* Select a proper duration
* Click `Create`

> [!Important]
> Make sure on the next screen, you copy the PAT token. Please communicate it in a secure way to the contributor with the expiration date.

## Setting up the TestStream pipeline in ADO

You need to add the specific pool `TestStream` to any ADO project where you want to run the hardware tests.

* Select the ADO project
* Go to `Project settings` on the bottom left
* Select `Agent pools`
* Click `Add pool` button on top right
* Select `Existing`, in the drop down select `TestStream`, click `Grant access`

* Click `Create`

## Adjusting an existing ADO yml file to add hardware support

Adjusting an existing ADO yml file to add the hardware tests is about transforming the existing pipeline into a multi stage pipeline and adding the test template. An example is in the [multi-stage.yaml](./multi-stage.yaml) file.

Add the folling block after the `resources` entry:

```yml
parameters:
- name: appComponents
  displayName: List of capabilities to run the tests on
  type: object
  default:
    - XIAO_ESP32C3
    - ESP32_C3_REV3
```

> [!Important]
> List all the firmware that are present in existing self hosted agents.

This will be adjusted with a git action later to browse existing agents and gather this information. So far, it's a manual gathering.

Transform the pool into a multi stage, don't forget to indent everything else in the yaml file:

```yml
stages:
- stage: Build
  displayName: 'Build'
  jobs:
  - job: Build
    displayName: 'Build job'
    pool:
      # default is the following VM Image
      vmImage: 'windows-latest'
```

Add a task at the end of your pipeline:

```yml
    - task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
      displayName: Publish Pipeline Artifact copy
      inputs:
        path: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)'
        artifactName: 'Artifacts'
```

This will publish all the built elements into the Azure artifact so that, the hardware tests will grab it to run them.

Add then this block at the very end, it will create multi stages that depends on the build and will run the hardware tests:

```yml
- ${{ each appComponents in parameters.appComponents }}:   
  - template: azure-pipelines-templates/device-test.yml
    parameters:
      appComponents: ${{ appComponents }}
      unitTestRunsettings: 
        - 'UnitTestStream/nano.runsettings,UnitTestStream/bin/Release/NFUnitTest.dll'
```

> [!Important]
> You have to list all the tests you want to run with each individual tests you want to run. Each line is a specific dll, separate the runsetting with the built dll with a coma.
